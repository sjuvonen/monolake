# Monolake

Monolake is a versatile music player. This project is currently in an experimental state. The mission is to develop a music player relying mostly on the Gnome JS bindings and stuff.

## Installation

Right now the app will/should/might start by executing `./monolake`. This is given that you've already installed all deps by coincidence and that they are relatively new and supported.

There is no actual installation method as of now.
